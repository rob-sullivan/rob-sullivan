## Research Work üîé

### Explaining Deep Q-Learning Experience Replay with SHAP

- I used Deep SHAP to explain a sub-component of deep Q learning called Experience Replay and show how its size can be tuned to improve efficiency of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
- Was honoured as the first in TU Dublin's School of computer science to publish in a journal during an MSc.
- Published this research and presented it at a conference in Lisbon, leading to it being featured on the cover of Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction scientific journal contributing to the ML community.
- [Thesis](https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&context=scschcomdis), [Paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3554/), [Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/5/4/72)

## Projects üöÄ

### Football Tracking AI Sports Journalist

- Use YOLO a pretrained deep learning computer vision model to detect players and ball in video clips. Go frame by frame to track their changes. Extract stats such as % ball possession, player formations, etc to create a 2d pitch allowing user to playback key events. Pass this as context for ChatGPT via API to allow user to query.
